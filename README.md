# C3.ai Therapeutic Agents/Drugs Mechanism of Action (MOA) and Performance Evaluation  
Repurposing of existing therapeutic agents (TAs) previously designed for other virus infections are being put on trials for the COVID19 patients for immediate disease control and management. A quick global overview on mechanism of action (MOA) and current status of the trials in terms of efficacy and safety is required for strategic life-saving and resource plannings. The planning managers or applicants of the treatments need to monitor both qualitative and quantitative growth of textual data objectively and make strategic decisions based on how situations, as depicted in the scientific reports, evolve.
